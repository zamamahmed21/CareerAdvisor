								<h2 style="font-weight: bold;  ">Purpose</h2>
								<p>As there is no ideal location for students where they may test themselves and discover a career according to their personality, it is becoming increasingly typical for students to be unable to find the ideal career. The career advisor will assist those students in finding the ideal career for them. Even if a student already has a goal in mind, the career advisor will advise them on what they can do to boost their cause quickly. Additionally, candidates can upload their resumes, which can then be distributed to various recruiters based on which resumes are the ideal matches for the open positions Through this, our platform may help three different types of people: job seekers, those who want to attain their goals, and students who are just looking for a career.</p>
								<h2 style="font-weight: bold; color: black; ">Scope</h2>
								<p> This one will feature a methodical approach that will make things incredibly simple for pupils. It will also assist people in learning more about their personalities and temperament. Additionally, it will give them thorough guidance and career roadmaps, making it much simpler for them to select the profession that would be the best fit for them. It could be implemented in various schools to ensure that each student is aware of the options available to them, and it could have a significant positive impact on the lives of many students. Additionally, job seekers can upload their resumes, which will be sent automatically to recruiters when a position matching their skills.</p>
